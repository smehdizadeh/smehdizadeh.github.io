### About the project ###

*Kool Edit 2020* is the result of a semester-long final project for MUSI 6106, a graduate-level audio software engineering course offered through the Music Technology department at Georgia Tech. Our aim was to build a standalone application with audio editing and playback capabilities that was responsive/lightweight, and had an intuitive GUI. We created the application using C++ and JUCE libraries, and as a team utilized an agile/scrum workflow.
