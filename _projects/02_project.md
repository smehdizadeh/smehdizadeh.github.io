### What is the Theremin? ###

The Theremin is an electronic musical instrument first developed around the 1930s. It has two RF oscillators and antennas that are affected by the proximity of the thereministâ€™s hands. One antenna controls the volume of the sound and the other controls the pitch of the sound, resulting in a smooth, ghostly tone.

The thereminist hovers their hands near the antennas, making minute and precise learned movements in space to play the instrument. Unlike more traditional instruments like the violin or the trombone, the thereminist does not rely on any tactile feedback from the instrument. This makes the Theremin a notoriously difficult instrument for humans to learn, which is why we thought it is the perfect instrument for a robotic musician!
