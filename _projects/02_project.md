### About the hackathon ###

*Syngeneia* was an interactive sound installation designed and built for the 2023 [SynthUX hackathon](https://www.synthux.academy/events/hackathon-2023).
Teams had four days to design, build, and document a project inspired by this year's theme of "acoustic bytes and artificial nature." For our project, we selected
the sub-prompt "a habitat for coexistence."
