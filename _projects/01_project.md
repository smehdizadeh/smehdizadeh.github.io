### About the piece ###

"Global Pandemic" is an EEG biofeedback performance. The goal of this piece was to create a modern rendition of Jacqueline Humbert's and [David Rosenboom's 1970s “Chilean Drought,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvt_MKBhSNs) that is not only current in terms of the technological implementation, but that also addresses a very current subject matter. While the original piece references Chile's Great Drought of the late 60s and was realized through extensive analog hardware, "Global Pandemic" was written about the COVID-19 pandemic and utilizes an OpenBCI EEG headband and a Max MSP patch. 

This rendition includes three instrumentals: piano (playing the original "Chilean Drought" score), tenor saxophone, and flute (both improvising). They accompany three groups of different vocal styles, as per the original piece. The relative audible levels of the three vocal groups are directly controlled by the brain performer, who is wearing an OpenBCI headband with 4 channels of EEG. She both intentionally modulates her brain waves as well allows herself to be influenced by what she is hearing, creating the biofeedback loop. Frequency band powers of theta, alpha, and beta waves are sent via OSC from OpenBCI to Max MSP, where they are directly mapped to the levels of the incoming microphone signals.

"Global Pandemic" was first performed at Georgia Tech's Brain Music Lab spring 2022 concert.
