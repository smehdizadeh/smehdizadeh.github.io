I am a music scientist and technologist, and I am passionate about exploring the powerful impacts that music can have in our everyday lives. Currently, I am pursuing a combined PhD in [Creative Technology & Design](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/academics/grad/ctd-phd), [Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/graduate-programs/cognitive-neuroscience-triple-phd) at the University of Colorado Boulder in the ATLAS Institute's [Brain Music Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/brain-music-lab). My dissertation investigates adolescent & young adult rewarding music listening experiences, including how different types of music reward and social listening contexts may be represented in the brain and consequently impact mood and prosocial behaviors.

I received my [Master's degree in Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, I was part of the Brain Music Lab (now at CU Boulder) as well as the student organization [Women in Music Tech @ GT](https://womeninmusictech.gatech.edu/). My studies and research focused on music perception & cognition, brain/body computer music systems, and cognitive science. Before coming to Georgia Tech, I spent close to two years as an audio engineer for the Advanced Development team at Mitsubishi Electric Automotive America.

I received my Bachelor's from the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering with a Music Minor, and was co-vice president and build team manager of [Michigan Project Music](https://michiganprojectmusic.github.io/)-- a student team that designs unique experimental musical instruments, often with complex electrical and structural components. Go Blue!
