I am passionate about music and audio technologies, and enjoy exploring how the worlds of music and engineering are intertwined. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in [Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/phd-music-technology) at Georgia Tech, where I also completed my Master's, and I am part of the [*Brain Music*](https://brainmusiclab.gatech.edu/) [*Lab*](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/brain-music). 

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I spent close to two years as part of the Advanced Development team at MEAA looking at new audio technologies we can bring into the vehicle to enhance our overall experience in the car. 

I received my Bachelor's from the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering with a Music Minor, and was co-vice president and build team manager of [Michigan Project Music](https://michiganprojectmusic.github.io/)-- a student team that designs unique experimental musical instruments, often with complex electrical and structural components.
