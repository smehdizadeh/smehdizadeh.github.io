I am passionate about music and audio technologies, and enjoy exploring how the worlds of music and engineering are intertwined. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in [Creative Technology & Design](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/academics/grad/ctd-phd) at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I am part of the ATLAS Institute's [Brain Music Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/brain-music-lab). 

I received my [Master's degree in Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, I was part of the Brain Music Lab (now at CU Boulder) as well as the student organization [Women in Music Tech @ GT](https://womeninmusictech.gatech.edu/). My studies and research focused on music perception & cognition, brain music, and cognitive science, culminating in my master's thesis ["Using Music to Modulate Emotional Memory"](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/66164). Before coming to Georgia Tech, I spent close to two years as part of the Advanced Development team at Mitsubishi Electric Automotive America looking at new audio technologies we can bring into the vehicle to enhance our overall experience in the car. 

I received my Bachelor's from the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering with a Music Minor, and was co-vice president and build team manager of [Michigan Project Music](https://michiganprojectmusic.github.io/)-- a student team that designs unique experimental musical instruments, often with complex electrical and structural components. Go Blue!
