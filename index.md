I am passionate about music and audio technologies, and enjoy exploring how the worlds of music and engineering are intertwined. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology) at Georgia Tech and am part of the *Brain Music Lab*. My research interests include psychophysiological correlates of musical preferences (PPG, EKG, respiration, EEG, fMRI), models for musical preference, and individualized experimental design. 

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I spent close to two years as part of the Advanced Development team at MEAA looking at new audio technologies we can bring into the vehicle to enhance our overall experience in the car. 

I received my Bachelor's from the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering with a Music Minor, and was co-vice president and build team manager of Michigan Project Music-- a student team that designs unique experimental musical instruments, often with complex electrical and structural components.
