title: "Orchestrion"
---

As a master's student at Georgia Tech I got to play guitar with [Shimon](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/shimon), a marimba-playing robotic musician! For our final project in the course Music Tech History & Repertoire, Mohammad Jafari, Eli Ruckle, and I recreated a portion of Pat Metheny's ["Orchestrion"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evHVh4bqaOQ).
