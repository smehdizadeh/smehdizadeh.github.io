**About the project**

EECS 351 is an elective electrical engineering course on digital signal processing and analysis. 
For our final project, my team chose to create an instrument recognition program using MATLAB. 
The goal of this software was to accurately classify musical instrument samples as either flute, saxophone, or violin, although it was designed with enough 
generality to accommodate other instruments as well. We worked with two methods of classification, support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). 
We trained and implemented both of these models and quantitatively evaluated their success. This project gave me hands on experience and taught me how to extract 
features from signals for analysis and deep/machine learning.

Our final deliverables were a class presentation and an [IEEE-style technical paper](/assets/files/351finalreport.pdf).
